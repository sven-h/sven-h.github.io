When inserting (mathematical) symbols in Word or PowerPoint or any other Office app,
you need to select the right font to see the unicode symbols. The tips come from [file format webpage](https://www.fileformat.info/tip/microsoft/enter_unicode.htm).

For mathematical symbols you should use `Cambria Math` to get to see corresponding unicode characters.

In case you search for some other symbols a helpful way is to use WordPad.

Just type the digits like `2202` (you should see them in the editor) and then press `Alt-X`.
Then have a look at the font selector to see which font contains your symbol.
